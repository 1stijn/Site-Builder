# Website Builder

Welcome to the Website Builder project! This Python-based tool allows users to generate and customize websites based on provided keywords and descriptions. It features various templates and customization options to help you create tailored web pages efficiently.

## Features

- **Template-Based Creation**: Choose from multiple templates (e.g., `jewelry.html`, `home.html`, `books.html`, etc.) to generate pages based on specific categories.
- **Customizable Content**: Input keywords and descriptions to generate tailored content for each page.
- **Easy Configuration**: Adjust settings and options to fit your needs with a straightforward terminal-based interface.

## How It Works

The script prompts you to select the difficulty mode (easy or hard) and asks questions based on your choice. It uses the provided keywords and descriptions to generate and log the resulting websites according to the selected template. The built-in customization options allow further tailoring of the output.
